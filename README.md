# PlaygroundCanvas
Easy Playground UIKit &amp; SpriteKit prototyping!

So, I decided to make it easier for everyone to prototype with UIKit and SpriteKit in a playground. This is mainly in response to numerous StackOverflow questions.

Hopefully, Apple allows Playground templates going forward. **fingers crossed**
