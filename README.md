# PlaygroundCanvas
Easy Playground UIKit &amp; SpriteKit prototyping!

So, I decided to make it easier for everyone to prototype with UIKit and SpriteKit in a playground. This is mainly in response to numerous StackOverflow questions.

Hopefully, Apple allows Playground templates going forward. **fingers crossed**

##Installation 
Just download the ZIP, open and get started with you're awesome prototypes!

## How to Use
1. Define the size of your canvas
2. Add all your cool prototypes
3. Call the `showView()` function on your canvas
4. Show your Assistant Editor in Xcode via **View** > **Assistant Editor** > **Show Assistant Editor** OR by the keyboard shortcut **Option + CMD + Z**
